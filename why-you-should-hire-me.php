            <h2>Why You Should Hire Me Over A Big Business</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="large-12 columns crumbs">
            <p>
              There are many reasons why you should hire me over a big business. Low overheads, minimal wait time, current technology, specialized skill set, face to face communication, only taking jobs that I'm interested in, and the fact that I actually care about my work are some of the main reasons for this. Just take a few minutes to let me go a little more in depth about this and you will most likely learn something that few business owners know.
            </p>
            <h3>Low Overhead</h3>
            <p>
              The main reason why hiring me, a freelancer over, a big business is in order to run a successful business you need to keep money coming in constantly. They have employees, insurance, benefits, and other bills to pay. All of which adds up to a pretty large portion of their income. Top this with taxes and there is sometimes little room for profit. To increase profits they must take on every single job they can, regardless of how capable they are. However with me you will not see the prices they require. I have none of these cost and I live a pretty minimalistic lifestyle. I am honestly happy just making enough money for me and my family to be secure and have a few nice things.
            </p>
            <h3>Minimal Wait Time</h3>
            <p>
              Big clients bring in the bulk of money for web companies and their jobs can take months or years to complete. These companies with million dollar contracts can easily spare 6k+ for a website, So why would they care about your small business. It may sound harsh but it is the truth.
              <br>
              <br>
              I don't have big clients so this means big clients wont be hogging up my time. My focus will be on your site.
            </p>
            <h3>Current Technology</h3>
            <p>
              Large companies usually run off a system. These systems are often times very out dated. In this industry where things change almost monthly, it's near impossible to keep the staff and systems up to date. Implementing these changes and effectively communicating to staff about these changes can take time. But the web waits for no one.
              <br>
              <br>
              As a freelancer I change how I work as soon as the technology does. There is no complex chain of approval needed.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another thing that I do extremely well that most companies don't (or charge a ton of money for) is responsive web design. Meaning that the sites I create will look good on any device your customer is using. Take a look at this site on any device you want. I bet it still looks good. Then take a look at your competitors sites. You will see why hiring me is better then hiring a big business.
            </p>
            <h3>Specialized Skill Set</h3>
            <p>
              Is the person at the big business fully qualified to build your site? Are they aware of the industries best practices and coding standards? Or is it some poorly paid employee rocking back in his chair, drinking pop while using Dreamweaver to build your site - without any real knowledge of what the code it creates actually does.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you end up going with one of these larger business, your designer will most likely be some low skilled college graduate, because that is the easiest road to take, and its where the money can be if you move up. This person is most likely 100% responsible for the look and feel of your site. The boss will most likely know almost nothing about web design, not care about it, and spend most of his time figuring out how he can make more money. If he can pay some college graduate $20+ and hour to crank out tons of horrible sites while charging you $200+ and hour, then he or she will.
              <br>
              <br>
              A skilled web designer like myself will be able to build your entire website using notepad. Unlike this boss, I am in love with creating awesome websites.
            </p>
            <h3>Face To Face Communication</h3> 
            <p>
              The problem with big businesses and communication does not lie in the ability to get a hold of someone. You will always be able to talk to someone, but you will almost never be able to talk to the right person. Someone with a marketing background will be listening to you, taking notes and then giving those notes to whoever is in charge of your project. Your voice gets lost and your real concerns are most likely brushed off by someone who is busy with 20+ other projects to worry about.
              <br>
              <br>
              With a freelancer like myself you will never have the issue of your voice not being heard. You will always talk to the person who is directly working on your project, and getting your point across is a whole lot easier.
              <br>
              <br>
              If you are to far for me to visit I am always able to skype with you.
            </p>
            <h3>I Only Take Jobs That I'm Interested In</h3>
            <p>
              I first got into web design/internet marketing because I wanted to create really awesome websites that people will love, and be able to use. This just is not possible working for a big company. I love what I do, and I inherit your love for your company too. When I work with a clients company I feel like I am part of the company too. I take pride in the company and want to deliver the best possible product that I can.
            </p>
            <h3>I Care About My Work</h3>
            <p>
              My livelihood depends on how much I care about my work. Everything I build for you is crafted with care. I absolutely refuse to create something that will not work for your business, or look anything less then pixel perfect. You will never see this kind of care go into your site with a big company. You will literally be just a number in a database to them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>To Sum It All Up</h2>
            <p>
              Working with a freelancer like myself has more benefits then going with a big business. My prices are around a third of what you would pay at these companies, and I will deliver the same or a better product. You get the most for your money by hiring me.
            </p>
